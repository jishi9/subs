1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We are heading to Santa Crocea,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
the city of Santa Crocea,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
the city of Santa Crocea.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We are heading to Santa Crocea,

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
the city of Santa Crocea,

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the city of Santa Crocea.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:30,000
City of San José

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We head north to Santa Cruz,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
the city of Santa Claesia.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We take the early train

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,500
from San Francisco to San José,

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,000
which pass from San Fransisco

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:01:03,000
From San Jose, a bus leads us through the high valleys of the coasts of California to Santa Cruz.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,480
A single night의 leisure

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,480
We are here and meeting with aLast describing Aryun Members of the boat.

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,680
Greetings, greetings.

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,680
It's the morning which we were born and it was time for us to do it all.

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,680
How is Sn �? Are you fine to come to Santa Cruz, with us?

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:54,680
I like it, I really like it a lot, I've been here for 4 years, Boston really liked it, the way the weather was, the weather was better, I like it very much in an academic medium, in Boston, and here, what changed, what changed Boston, and more here, is the anti-priority medium, over there, here it is much better than in the development, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here

20
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:04,940
it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better, here it is much better,

21
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:15,680
and I have very little of 1917 classroom, life as a mouse is down, and most of time I get back, or yeah, plant consumer,

22
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,680
So he has the vibe of a boss too.

23
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,680
A city of vacancies.

24
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,680
But at the same time, he is a member of the Comunitaries.

25
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,680
So he is very much the vibe of the boss of Antepinoriat.

26
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,680
He does the start-up, yes.

27
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Olimpic?

28
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,680
At the Mathematica.

29
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
The National Republic?

30
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,680
Yes, yes, yes.

31
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
National...

32
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,680
Yes, I went to the National Monument.

33
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,680
Yes, I did a lot of things.

34
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,680
And he had a lot of courses.

35
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,680
He had courses that he was holding.

36
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,680
How many courses did he attend?

37
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,680
Until I entered the national team.

38
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,680
But I didn't enter the national team,

39
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,680
the international team, the middle class, or the Balkan team.

40
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,680
This is something that seems to be missing here in America.

41
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,680
That there is no vibe of the Olympic Games,

42
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,680
that is in Romania.

43
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,680
And it is really an extraordinary thing that happened in Romania.

44
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,680
Because we had the Olympic Games, we were together.

45
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,680
And what do you think is missing here in the education system

46
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,680
from the United States and the United States?

47
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
Yes, public speaking.

48
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,680
Talking to the public, the communication,

49
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
these things that are missing.

50
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,680
And rhetoric.

51
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,680
Rhetoric, yes.

52
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,680
Yes.

53
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,680
How do you learn?

54
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,680
Yes, it is done in school.

55
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,680
Here on the right is the entrance to the campus.

56
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,680
Ok.

57
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,680
The California University.

58
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,680
What is the tax level at the public university

59
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,680
and a private university in the United States?

60
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,680
A private university, about 40, between 40 and 60 thousand dollars per year.

61
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
Yes.

62
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,680
At a public university, something less.

63
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,680
And you are from the United States?

64
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,680
Yes.

65
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,680
Yes, I am American.

66
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,680
And where did you two meet?

67
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,680
I actually met with two supermen.

68
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,680
Seriously?

69
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
Yes, yes.

70
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,680
Congratulations.

71
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
Congratulations.

72
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
So, are you in a hurry now?

73
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
I haven't had the time to do anything,

74
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,680
but I am in December, in Hawaii.

75
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
Ok.

76
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
Yes.

77
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,680
I have started to believe.

78
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,680
I wanted to be in the north of San Francisco,

79
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,680
in a Jewish city, so to speak,

80
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,680
in the Middle East.

81
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,680
Yes.

82
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,680
And my parents came, my parents,

83
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,680
some of my friends.

84
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,680
They are Redwoods.

85
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,680
Are the traces of sequoias in the area here?

86
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
Yes, in the summer, in the summer,

87
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
we go down in three months.

88
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,680
Seriously?

89
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,680
Yes.

90
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,680
Yes.

91
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
Yes.

92
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,680
Yes.

93
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,680
Yes.

94
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,680
I have been in that area for a long time.

95
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,680
Yes.

96
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
Really.

97
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,680
Ok.

98
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,680
So, what do you do now?

99
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
I make artificial models,

100
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,680
applied in the medical field,

101
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,680
in the creer field.

102
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,680
So, in this artificial model,

103
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,680
I can work with the image of the creer

104
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,680
and reconstruct the parts of the image.

105
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,680
Is it for diagnosis, prognosis,

106
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,680
modeling in the time of the patients?

107
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,680
I have seen that the researches,

108
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,680
recently, are taking care of Alzheimer's,

109
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,680
Huntington, for example,

110
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
to clarify a lot of things.

111
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,680
Yes.

112
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,680
Yes.

113
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,680
And in this field,

114
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,680
what is the result of the research?

115
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,680
I have more work.

116
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,680
In the first round,

117
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,680
I have done one of the first studies

118
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,680
on a rare type of dementia,

119
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,680
which is similar to Alzheimer's,

120
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,680
but it affects the visual center of the creer.

121
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,680
The dementia is called

122
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
the posterior cortical atrophy.

123
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,680
I published one of the first studies

124
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,680
in which I studied systematically

125
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,680
102 patients,

126
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,680
more than 200 patients who have this disease,

127
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,680
and I have modeled the evolution of the disease in time.

128
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,680
I have seen how the atrophy of the matrix evolves,

129
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,680
and how the degree of action,

130
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,680
cognitive tests,

131
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,680
And what was the conclusion of this study?

132
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Well, according to Alzheimer's,

133
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
it appears more time-consuming,

134
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
about 10-15 years later,

135
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,680
it affects the visual center,

136
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,680
not the memory, it affects the vision.

137
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,680
Initially, the first diagnosis

138
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,680
was that it had problems with the eye,

139
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,680
but the surgery on the eye,

140
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,680
which are absolutely unnecessary,

141
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,680
they have problems with the cremation of the eye.

142
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
How could you use medicine,

143
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,680
this research?

144
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,680
It can be used more well as a diagnosis,

145
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,680
but also to understand how the disease evolves.

146
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
Until now, you didn't know.

147
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
Medicines can use,

148
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,680
from our study,

149
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,680
understand how it evolves in time.

150
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,680
To give information to the patient

151
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,680
and say,

152
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,680
we already have this disease,

153
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,680
because of the studies we have done,

154
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,680
we can tell the patient

155
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,680
what will happen in 1 year,

156
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,680
in 3 years, with her in 5 years.

157
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,680
The idea was to build a mathematical model,

158
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,680
you are an informatic,

159
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
here you are a doctor, right?

160
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,680
I'm not a doctor,

161
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,680
but I collaborated with doctors in London,

162
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
so the research I did in London,

163
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,680
during my doctorate,

164
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,680
and I collaborated with doctors,

165
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,680
but I was serious about math

166
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,680
and I did a lot of mathematical and informatic models

167
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,680
at Boli.

168
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,680
And it's a very important thing,

169
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,680
to bring these disciplines together.

170
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,680
Most of the discoveries I made today

171
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,680
are at the intersection of the most disciplines.

172
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,680
In the case of Alzheimer's,

173
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,680
what was your contribution,

174
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,680
what did you come up with?

175
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,680
A mathematical model,

176
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,680
implementation in the algorithm

177
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
of the same mathematical model.

178
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
It's a prognosis in time.

179
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,680
You had a clinical study,

180
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
you had a number of patients,

181
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,680
and the dates of the accident are a period of time.

182
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,680
Yes, I had the biggest number of patients

183
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
with this ball at the moment in front of them,

184
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,680
in the world.

185
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
That number of patients

186
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,680
that have this rare ball,

187
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,680
it's phenomenal, it's a very big number.

188
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,680
And this allowed us to train those models,

189
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,680
because they were models that needed a lot of health,

190
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,680
they were more complex,

191
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,680
and only 5 patients, for example,

192
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
were not enough.

193
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,680
In the case of this reconstruction, for example,

194
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,680
when we have a weak resolution,

195
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,680
what would be the utility of this research?

196
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,680
In order to make the scans more effective,

197
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,680
much better, much clearer,

198
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,680
faster.

199
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,680
Yes, this is the third one,

200
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,680
so better than the resolution,

201
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
the contrast,

202
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,680
to see more, I think,

203
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,680
than it offers us many faces.

204
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,680
The microscope that will make a 10x magnification

205
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
makes 50x.

206
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
Miza, let's make the images to be better,

207
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
and faster.

208
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,680
A remnant can last an hour,

209
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,680
even an hour and a half.

210
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,680
And you think you will stay in a scanner

211
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,680
of this remnant, an hour and a half,

212
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,680
unmoved, it's very complicated,

213
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,680
especially if you have a ball with Parkinson's

214
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,680
in which it's shaking, and you can't stay unmoved.

215
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,680
Or, for example, if you want to scan

216
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
a little baby, or a very small baby,

217
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,680
who can't understand that you're not moving

218
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,680
in a scanner, or even images

219
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,680
of fetuses in the breast of their mothers,

220
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,680
they are made in remnant,

221
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,680
and that's how the fetus moves,

222
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,680
and you can't control the day.

223
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
And then you have to make the images

224
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,680
to be faster and clearer.

225
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,680
And this is the stabilizer,

226
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,680
which is the degree of accuracy

227
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,680
for this kind of reconstruction.

228
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,680
If a doctor puts a diagnosis

229
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,680
of the reconstruction you're offering,

230
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,680
it must be sure that the accuracy

231
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,680
is quite high, right?

232
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
Yes, yes, yes.

233
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,680
For the other diagnosis,

234
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,680
we have the accuracy in the face

235
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,680
of the biggest of 90%,

236
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,680
about 93%.

237
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,680
We could, for example,

238
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,680
predict in a reasonable term,

239
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,680
10, 15 years,

240
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,680
a doctor in his office

241
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,680
could have at his disposal

242
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,680
these models,

243
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,680
and we should,

244
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,680
simply, the calculator

245
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,680
to make, for example,

246
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,680
a remnant, for example,

247
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,680
a child or a child from the park.

248
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,680
Exactly, that's what we hope

249
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,680
and dream to do,

250
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,680
in the near future,

251
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,680
as a doctor,

252
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,680
to be in a hospital clinic,

253
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,680
in the family clinic,

254
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
for example,

255
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,680
we can give the patient's peace,

256
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,680
to make a prescription for the patient,

257
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
to treat any kind of pain,

258
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,680
and to make the doctor's recommendation.

259
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,680
We recommend that the patient

260
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,680
get the X medication,

261
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
or go to the pharmacy

262
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
to get a Y therapy.

263
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,680
That means that you will also

264
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,680
get that integrated, personalized medical model,

265
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,680
about which you are all talking about,

266
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,680
an active intelligence doctor.

267
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,680
If you have access to many types of data

268
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,680
from the patient,

269
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,680
the model can be a prescription

270
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,680
for that personalized patient.

271
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,680
I understand that the model can also explore

272
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,680
thousands of millions,

273
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,680
millions of medical cases,

274
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,680
similar to the patient's past,

275
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,680
that can be scanned immediately from the database.

276
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,680
The main projects we are working on

277
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,680
are the assembly of a hepatitis B virus.

278
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
This is an animation

279
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,680
that shows how it is assembled,

280
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,680
this particular part of the hepatitis B virus,

281
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,680
starts with this structure of 6 proteins

282
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,680
that form a critical work of the virus,

283
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,680
and it will be very stable

284
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,680
from the point of view of energy.

285
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,680
Then there are many other proteins,

286
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,680
one by one, one by one,

287
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,680
and it is assembled around this nucleus,

288
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,680
and this is how the virus is formed,

289
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,680
in nature it lasts from a few milliseconds

290
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,680
to a few seconds,

291
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,680
depending on the virus,

292
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
it is like this, it is assembled.

293
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,680
And this was not known,

294
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,680
but it was not until now

295
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,680
that there was no simulation that was done.

296
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,680
We are trying to do the first simulation

297
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,680
on the calculator, at the atomic level,

298
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,680
to assemble a virus,

299
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,680
regardless of the virus.

300
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
The virus looks very beautiful here,

301
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,680
you could say it is an image.

302
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,680
What does atomic level mean?

303
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,680
At the atomic level it means that

304
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,680
here we have 240 proteins

305
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
in total, in the whole virus,

306
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
and we simulate each atom

307
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,680
from the inside of the protein,

308
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,680
a protein has 2200 and something like that,

309
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,680
2200 and 2300 atoms.

310
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,680
There are four types of proteins,

311
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,680
red, yellow,

312
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,680
and white, and two white.

313
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,680
Each protein is composed of

314
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,680
very many atoms that we can see

315
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,680
and we can grow.

316
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,680
For example, we have this structure of 6 carbons,

317
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,680
hydrogen in the heads,

318
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,680
let's say, benzene molecules,

319
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,680
oxygen, hydrogen,

320
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,680
atoms in the albaster are nitrogen,

321
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,680
and

322
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,680
between each atom

323
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,680
we calculate the force,

324
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,680
attraction and thrust

325
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,680
of each atom.

326
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,680
And we do this with all the atoms,

327
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,680
which are 1000 atoms,

328
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,680
only here we have 12000 atoms,

329
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,680
and then we have 5 forces

330
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,680
between each atom's force

331
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,680
and then

332
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,680
we integrate them in this force.

333
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,680
And if the force says

334
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,680
that the atom moves in that direction,

335
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,680
we move it in the direction of its position

336
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,680
and then we do all this,

337
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,680
and we repeat it

338
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,680
for billions of steps,

339
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,680
billions of times.

340
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,680
And for this you need

341
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,680
a very large amount of math,

342
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,680
on the other hand, a large amount of calculation.

343
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,680
How do you find them in Mundovo?

344
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,680
Yes, we need both.

345
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,680
The mathematical models already existed,

346
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,680
the whole virus has 500,000 atoms,

347
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,680
and the whole virus has been captured,

348
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,680
without putting the DNA of the virus

349
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,680
or the DNA of the virus.

350
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,680
We have half a million atoms,

351
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,680
and we need incredible professors for this.

352
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,680
And

353
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,680
at the moment we have found

354
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,680
two places where we can make a simulation.

355
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,680
One is a super computer at Berkeley,

356
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,680
which we run and have

357
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,680
around 18,000 GPUs,

358
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,680
which are the best ones,

359
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,680
in fact.

360
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,680
And it's a GPU.

361
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,680
I don't like video,

362
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,680
I want to say

363
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,680
20 years,

364
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,680
maybe even earlier,

365
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,680
if we had a serious investment

366
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,680
even earlier,

367
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,680
we could simulate the whole cell.

368
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,680
At the atomic level.

369
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,680
And people could ask the spectators

370
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,680
why it's so complicated.

371
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,680
Why is it so complicated? We don't have

372
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,680
the power to do the processing

373
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,680
to simulate it.

374
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,680
The smallest cell

375
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,680
to be called a microplasma has

376
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,680
6 billion atoms.

377
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,680
There are a lot of them.

378
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,680
And to simulate it

379
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,680
for a few milliseconds

380
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,680
it's really an incredible task

381
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,680
that we can't do at the moment.

382
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,680
We can simulate a billion atoms

383
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,680
at the same level, but only for

384
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,680
one or two seconds.

385
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,680
A million times more,

386
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,680
if necessary, to simulate it.

387
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,680
And what would be the usefulness

388
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,680
of this process?

389
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,680
To understand the biological potential

390
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,680
of these proteins that act

391
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,680
in the cells, what happens.

392
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,680
What do you know about biological processes

393
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,680
in cells? We can understand them

394
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,680
much better.

395
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,680
And the second thing is to discover

396
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,680
the medicines, much more sophisticated

397
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,680
and much more interesting,

398
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,680
I would say.

399
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,680
If you have a simulation, you can put a medicine

400
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,680
in the cell to see what happens.

401
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,680
You simulate the cell and see

402
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,680
how it changes a process of proteins

403
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,680
that is no longer

404
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,680
lighter than before

405
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,680
or blocks a cell that can

406
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,680
develop in those cells.

407
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,680
In the case of this virus that has already

408
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,680
been able to

409
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,680
visualize it,

410
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,680
this model could have already been used.

411
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,680
We already have similar medicines

412
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,680
and 4 proteins.

413
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,680
We want to increase the scale

414
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,680
to make as many

415
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,680
as possible, as many proteins.

416
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,680
What is important?

417
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,680
We want the medicine to stay

418
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,680
as much as possible in the area

419
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,680
where it should be, and if it is,

420
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,680
it means that it is not enough

421
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,680
to be in this area

422
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,680
and it means that we will modify the molecule

423
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,680
to make it better

424
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,680
in the area where it should be,

425
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,680
in this binding pocket.

426
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,680
So it is possible that after 10 or

427
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,680
at least 20 years

428
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,680
when you create this model

429
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,680
a big pharmaceutical company

430
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,680
will come to buy this application

431
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,680
and you will have billionaires.

432
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,680
It is possible.

433
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,680
These stages will make

434
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,680
some big pharmaceutical giants

435
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,680
but

436
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,680
the initial phases with simulations

437
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,680
and with special techniques

438
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,680
we can also do.

439
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,680
We bring the medicine to a point

440
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,680
where it seems to be less

441
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,680
and it can be too much

442
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,680
of a pharmaceutical giant.

443
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,680
Isn't it huge?

444
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,680
We can have الم Frozen

445
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,680
models,

446
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,680
assistants and another

447
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,680
specialist.

448
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,680
cytoh sembla

449
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,680
What took you more than a while on the table?

450
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,680
I had a discussion with one of Manolis's projects,

451
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,680
which tries to make models of image records.

452
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:53,680
I wanted to reconstruct 3D images from 2D images.

453
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
Where is Manolis?

454
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,680
Manolis is from Greece, in this way.

455
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,680
It's the one that's left behind.

456
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,680
It's the one that's left behind.

457
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,680
It's the one that's left behind.

458
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,680
What's Manolis?

459
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,680
Manolis is from Greece, in this way.

460
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,680
It's the one that's left behind.

461
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,680
Do you choose students?

462
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,680
I choose them.

463
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,680
I choose them.

464
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,680
I'm the second one.

465
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,680
The first one is the fourth one,

466
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,680
in front of me.

467
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,680
I choose them from all the applications.

468
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,680
We have 1400 applications,

469
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,680
all of them from the last year.

470
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
1400 applications.

471
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,680
1400 applications.

472
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,680
I was a teacher from the other side.

473
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,680
I only helped 35 students.

474
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,680
What's your quota?

475
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,680
I took two.

476
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,680
I can take as many students as I want,

477
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,680
depending on the financial situation.

478
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,680
If I have enough money, I can take more.

479
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,680
Where do you get the money?

480
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,680
I get the money from the University of California system,

481
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,680
where I get the money for each campus,

482
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,680
for us and for all the other campuses.

483
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,680
I get the money from other departments,

484
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,680
from the government of California and the federal government.

485
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
I have many sources.

486
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,680
What were the criteria when you chose them?

487
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,680
To know very well,

488
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,680
informally and mathematically.

489
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
In general,

490
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,680
to have something to do with artificial intelligence,

491
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,680
until now, modeling,

492
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,680
and usually, there are other qualities

493
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,680
that I forget.

494
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,680
But here, it varies from one to the other.

495
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,680
How many students do you have?

496
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,680
I teach automatic learning,

497
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,680
artificial intelligence,

498
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,680
so, learning and AI.

499
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,680
I had 80 students.

500
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,680
It's the most successful subject at the moment.

501
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,680
Yes, yes.

502
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,680
We have a lot of requests for these courses.

503
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,680
How do you know when the doctorate has been completed

504
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,680
and their research has reached the end?

505
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,680
And how long can it last?

506
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,680
Can it last for 3, 5 or 10 years?

507
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,680
Yes.

508
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,680
How long can it last?

509
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,680
5 or 6 years here in America,

510
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,680
this is the doctorate here.

511
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,680
We know how,

512
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,680
when the work is financed,

513
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,680
when the project is closed,

514
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,680
which they worked on

515
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
in the following years,

516
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,680
and the end of the year,

517
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,680
then it can be completed.

518
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,680
The doctorate can be completed.

519
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,680
When you arrived in London to study,

520
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,680
did you already know that you wanted to become a professor?

521
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,680
Yes.

522
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,680
Yes, I wanted to do research.

523
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,680
I already knew that.

524
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,680
If you want to be a professor,

525
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,680
you have to do research,

526
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,680
to get money to...

527
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Yes, yes, yes.

528
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,680
Is there a better system than the one in the UK?

529
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,680
Yes.

530
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,680
At the academic level,

531
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,680
it's a better system and a better research.

532
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,680
Here in America.

533
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,680
Because it's more pragmatic?

534
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,680
No, it's more financial.

535
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,680
And what do you know that the government

536
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,680
is listening to you?

537
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,680
Yes, a lot, a lot.

538
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,680
It can create

539
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,680
ecosystems with this kind of financing.

540
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,680
It can create an ecosystem

541
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,680
in which a lot of talent comes,

542
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,680
talented people,

543
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,680
teachers, students,

544
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,680
and create an ecosystem

545
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,680
that can be...

546
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,680
For example, Silicon Valley.

547
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,680
It was started

548
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,680
in the 1960s

549
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,680
around Stanford.

550
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,680
And there was the expectation

551
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,680
that it did very, very well.

552
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,680
And many companies started coming.

553
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,680
To make a stadium there

554
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,680
next to the university.

555
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,680
And then they grew up.

556
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,680
And then the investors came

557
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,680
from the capital risk fund,

558
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,680
venture capital funds.

559
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,680
They invested more,

560
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,680
they put in a lot of startups.

561
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,680
What do you think about the future?

562
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,680
I've been waiting for

563
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,680
many years to start

564
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,680
entering this field.

565
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,680
It's a very big potential

566
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,680
to make a stadium even better

567
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,680
than what we have now.

568
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,680
Which are much more exponential,

569
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,680
faster.

570
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,680
It's not really a hyperbole,

571
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,680
it's really exponential.

572
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,680
And it can revolutionize many fields,

573
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,680
including medicine and biology.

574
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,680
It's a protein symbol

575
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,680
that can be accelerated

576
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,680
with a lot of information,

577
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,680
with other quantities.

578
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,680
And on your personal plan,

579
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,680
but being that it's still cut

580
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,680
in two weeks,

581
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,680
what plan do you have?

582
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,680
Yes, I've been cut

583
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,680
in two weeks.

584
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,680
And yes, we're planning

585
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,680
to stay here.

586
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,680
We also have a house here.

587
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,680
With a healthy, of course,

588
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,680
so we'll stay here for a while.

589
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,680
What do you think about the future?

590
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,680
What do you think about the future?

591
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,680
What do you think about the future?

592
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,680
What do you think about the future?

593
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,680
What do you think about the future?

594
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,680
What do you think about the future?

595
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,680
What do you think about the future?

596
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,680
What do you think about the future?

597
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,680
What do you think about the future?

598
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,680
What do you think about the future?

599
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,680
What do you think about the future?

600
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,680
What do you think about the future?

601
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,680
What do you think about the future?

602
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,680
What do you think about the future?
